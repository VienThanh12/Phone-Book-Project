# Description of Project
A phonebook to save the name and number of a person 

**1. Access the Phonebook Application:**
* You  visit [https://phone-book-j06k.onrender.com/](https://phone-book-j06k.onrender.com/).
  
**2. View Existing Contacts:**
* Upon accessing the phonebook application, you are able to view a list of existing contacts if any have been added.
3. View Existing Contacts:
Upon accessing the phonebook application, you should be able to view a list of existing contacts if any have been added. The contacts may be displayed in a table or a list, showing relevant information such as names, phone numbers, or email addresses.

Add a Contact:
To add a new contact, look for an "Add Contact" or "New Contact" button or form on the user interface. Clicking the button or submitting the form should prompt you to enter the relevant details of the new contact, such as name, phone number, and email address. After entering the information, submit the form to save the contact.

Edit a Contact:
If you need to update the details of an existing contact, locate an "Edit" or "Update" button or link associated with the contact. Clicking on this button or link should display a form pre-populated with the existing contact information. Modify the desired fields and submit the form to save the changes.

Delete a Contact:
To remove a contact from the phonebook, find a "Delete" or "Remove" button or link associated with the contact you wish to delete. Clicking on this option should prompt a confirmation dialogue to ensure you want to proceed with the deletion. Confirm the deletion, and the contact should be removed from the phonebook.

Search and Filter Contacts:
If the phonebook application supports search or filtering functionality, look for a search bar or filter options. You can enter search terms or select specific criteria to narrow down the displayed contacts based on your requirements.

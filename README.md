# Description of Project
A phonebook to save the name and number of a person 

**1. Access the Phonebook Application:**
* You  visit [https://phone-book-j06k.onrender.com/](https://phone-book-j06k.onrender.com/).
  
**2. View Existing Contacts:**
* Upon accessing the phonebook application, you are able to view a list of existing contacts if any have been added.

**3. Add a Contact:**
* To add a new contact, look for an "Add" button or form on the user interface. Clicking the button should prompt you to enter the relevant details of the new contact, such as name, and phone number. After entering the information, submit the form to save the contact.
And remember that the phone number needs to be in this format DDD-DDDDDDD or DD-DDDDDDD and more than 8 characters

**4. Edit a Contact:**
* If you need to update the details of an existing contact, you write the same name and a different number. Clicking the button should change the number of contact.

**5. Delete a Contact:**
* To remove a contact from the phonebook, find a "Delete"  button or link associated with the contact you wish to delete. Clicking on this option should prompt a confirmation dialogue to ensure you want to proceed with the deletion. Confirm the deletion, and the contact should be removed from the phonebook.

**6. Search and Filter Contacts:**
* If the phonebook application supports search or filtering functionality, look for a search bar or filter options. You can enter search terms or select specific criteria to narrow down the displayed contacts based on your requirements.
